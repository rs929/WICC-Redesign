  <h3>Community</h3>

  <p>WICC&apos;s Community team regularly engages with students interested in tech through our mentorship program,
    allyship workshops, and socials. Our goal is to help foster meaningful relationships and make anyone feel included
    and welcome in CIS at Cornell. In the past we&rsquo;ve hosted the WICC Away retreat and CIS Formal, held community
    discussions on speaking up for yourself, and hosted multiple allyship events in collaboration with other
    organizations at Cornell.</p>

  <h4>Focus: Mentorship, Allyship, Social</h4>

  <h3>Academic</h3>

  <p>WICC works to expand opportunities and provide career support by publicizing opportunities for women, hosting
    alumni women panels, tech talks and networking events with companies.</p>

  <h4>Focus: Career Development, Faculty & Alumni Relations, Underclassmen Outreach</h4>

  <h3>Outreach</h3>

  <p>WICC extends our influence through outreach aimed at inspiring young students to consider and pursue fields in
    tech. We run a weekly Girls Who Code program for high school and middle students in the Ithaca area, intended to
    teach our students the basic principles of computing and encouraging the possibilities beyond these basics. In
    addition, we host a series of workshops with the Tompkins Public Library three times a semester, aimed at problem
    solving, critical thinking, and robotics to give younger students a taste of the power of technology. Other
    workshops in collaboration with organizations like Splash and Hack For Impact are also hosted throughout each
    semester as a blend of both programs to target a more casual setting for exploring both areas.</p>

  <h4>Focus: Girls Who Code Program & Tompkins County Robotic Workshops</h4>

  <h3>Brand</h3>

  <p>WICC maintains its vision through the brand team, which is in charge of photography, designs, social media, and the
    website. Follow us on our Instagram @wiccornell !</p>

  <h4>Focus: Website, Design, Media</h4>

  <h3>Corporate</h3>

  <p>WICC partners with many corporate sponsors to host engaging information sessions and other fun events to provide
    opportunities to learn about internship and full-time roles.</p>

  <h4>Focus: Information Sessions, Tech Talks, Networking</h4>
