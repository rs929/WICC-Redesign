    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <p>WICC was founded in March 2013 to bring together women and gender minorities in computing fields at
      <strong>Cornell University</strong>,
      expand their opportunities and successes, provide a support network, and empower them to encourage younger
      underrepresented students to consider computing fields. We hope to create a budding community and promote
      interaction on academic, social, and professional issues. By making women and gender minorities in computing
      fields visible, providing role models and dispelling stereotypes, WICC fosters a support network to empower
      everyone and encourage young students to discover their love for computing.

    <h2>Alumni</h2>
    <p>WICC is creating a network that allows current WICC members to reach out to alumni to ask for advice on academic,
      social and professional issues. Should you choose to participate in this network, we would ask your permission
      before putting any WICC members with interests similar to yours in contact with you. You don't have to have been
      in WICC during your time at Cornell or even strictly a CS major to participate. WICC would truly appreciate your
      participation in this program and we welcome anyone who wishes to create an even wider support network for women
      in computer science and women considering joining our community.</p>
