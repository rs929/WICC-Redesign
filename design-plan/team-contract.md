# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    We will meet on a weekly basis and start the project early, and we will communicate with each other through imessages to make sure that we are all on top of our deadlines. We also want to ensure that everyone contributes an equal amount of work towards the project

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - Make sure to keep in contact through iMessage or zoom meetings so that everyone is updated on progress for the website
    - Send and accept GCals for meetings
    - Discuss meeting times on iMessage so that everyone is included
    - Be respectful in group chats

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We will meet on a weekly basis through zoom and will set up a meeting time every week to find a time that everyone is availible

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    We will be communicating with them through email initially and meet with them via Zoom as needed for audience information and to understand their goals and aims.


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

   - Liaison/Outreach: This person will be reaching out to the clients and be the primary point-of-contact. They will also be coordinating Zooms and meetings we have with our client as a group.
   - Project Manager: This person will set times for group members to meet and make sure project goals and requirements are being met. They will make sure the meetings are also staying on track and using time properly.
   - UX Researcher: This person will be responsible in charge of the user experience aspect, such as designing tasks and coordinating user interviews.


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

   - You are not contributing as the tasks that you are assigned and we were wondering if you needed any help or confirmation
   - Could you submit your portion of the assignment, the deadline is coming up and we want to make sure that we submit everything on time
   - Set google calendar invites for meetings
   - Set up mini deadlines for tasks to ensure that they finish on time

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

   - Find mutual ground so we can agree on
   - Consider all sides and reach an objective agreement
   - Try to reach a democratic consesnus
   - Be respectful when disagreeing with other peoples input

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    - Upon disagreement reference the team contract to clarify

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause....

    - We can make sure that everyone who gets a role is satisfied and happy with their tasks
    - We can have a team social and get coffee or something

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
